# CSC207FinalProject
### Hello marker,
 For phase 1, we have implemented firebase's database in android studio:
 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csc207-tli/database/csc207-tli/data
 and the firebase's authentication in our android studio: 
 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csc207-tli/authentication/users. Therefore, the login page works correctly when you login with the corresponding username and password that you signed up with.
 We have also done the base work for the front end. The buttons will lead to the desired following pages.
 We also have an unimplemented framework for the different users. 
 
 Thanks!

# CSC207FinalProject
### Hello marker,
 For phase 1, we have implemented firebase's database in android studio:
 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csc207-tli/database/csc207-tli/data
 and the firebase's authentication in our android studio: 
 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csc207-tli/authentication/users 
 We have also done the base work for the front end. The buttons will lead to the desired following pages.
 We also have an unimplemented framework for the different users.
 
 Thanks!
